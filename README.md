## 💌 Let's Connect!
Whether you're looking for a collaboration, have a question, or just want to ~~say hi~~ travel the world together, I'm ~~not always~~ here!
- Shoot me an email: (Still deciding which one of my 100 email addresses to share.)
- Connect on LinkedIn: linkedin.com/in/lu-kathleen
- Check out my portfolio: (Be patient, my website URL is on its way!)

And in case I wasn't here, you can always:
- Send me your owl
- Signal me with smoke signs
- Mind-link me, if you're capable

Can't wait to create something amazing (and perhaps travel the world) together (or alone)! 🚀
